## bio
i'm a 15-year-old game dev & sorta 3d artist. i like turning my imagination into reality through code and 3d art. i've been making games and small side-projects here and there for over 4 years.

that's basically it. i just like making stuff. i do have an indie game studio, [Xintegrate Studios](https://github.com/Xintegrate-Studios), where i work on my personal projects. i also co-founded another game studio with my friend from school called [Noe Co.](https://noeco.xyz/) where i'm working on my biggest project yet, [Expland](https://noeco.xyz/games/expland).
